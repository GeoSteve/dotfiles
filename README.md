# Steve's dotfiles

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

This repo is mostly for me but you're welcome to make suggestions. Mathias's is the project to fork.  I'm mostly catching up to him, @cowboy, @gf3, and @paul_irish.

## install the necessary apps

My basic setup is captured in `install-deps.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`

I do something nice with my `PATH` there:

```shell
# PATH like a bawss
PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly
# ...

export PATH
```

## Syntax highlighting

â€¦is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)


### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

## Similar projects

I recommend getting a [`.jshintrc`](https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc) and [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) defined for all your projects.
